# PrettyPropTypes

PrettyPropTypes is designed to display the output of
[extract-react-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-react-types). It is
designed to read the output from `extract-react-types`, and display rich prop
information for consumers.

## Core usage pattern

```js
<Props
  heading="My Cool Component"
  props={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../MyCoolComponent')}
/>
```

This analyses prop type definitions, and default props. It creates descriptions
from comments before the type definitions, and will render markdown syntax using [react-markings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markings).

## Quick Tips

* Using [extract-react-types-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-react-types-loader)
  is definitely the easiest way to get this information from your components, however
  you can prebuild this data with `extract-react-types` and read it from a file if
  you prefer.
* When using `extract-react-types`, it currently looks only at the default export
  of a file, with the assumption that it is a react class component.

## Customisation Props

### Heading

Display a heading for the collection of props. Pass in an empty string if you want
no heading, otherwise it defaults to "Props".

### shouldCollapseProps

Set whether the prop shapes should be shown by default, or whether they should
be hidden, and require being expanded.

### Components

Accepts an object that allows you to override particular style components within
our prop definition. The currently modifiable components are:

* Indent
* Outline
* Required
* Type
* StringType
* TypeMeta

Any that are not passed in will use the default component.

## Overrides

The `override` prop allows you to override a specific prop's definition. If you
want to keep the appearance aligned, we recommend using the `Prop` export from
PrettyPropType.

An override is invoked with all the props passed to the Prop component internally,
and renders the result. In the example below, we are changing the `type` field,
and stopping the shape component from appearing, while leaving other parts of the
component the same.

```js
import Props, { Prop } from 'pretty-proptypes'

${<Props
  heading=""
  props={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../../PropTypes/Select')}
  overrides={{
    components: (props) => <Prop {...props} shapeComponent={() => null} type="All Components Object" /> }}
/>}
```

While you can pass style `components` directly to `Prop`, we recommend passing
style components in the top level Props, and letting them flow down.
